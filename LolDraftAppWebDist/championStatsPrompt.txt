I am building a League of Legends draft analysis tool. I need you (a professional league of legends coach) to generate accurate champion characteristics in JSON format for every champion in order as of patch 15.17 (Sept 6, 2025). 

Rules (strict): 
1. Each subcategories must have a score between 1-5.
2. Distribute points based on champion identity, teamfight impact, and stage-specific effectiveness. 
3. DO NOT LOOK AT META, base the score off champion mechanics.
4. Base allocations on champion identity, teamfight impact, and game-stage relevance. 
5. Follow the JSON structure exactly as shown below. 

Guidance for categories: 
-DamageProfile → Assign points based on raw damage output. 
-DamageType / Survivability / CrowdControl → Assign based on teamfight impact. 
-Utility → Assign based on macro/game impact, like waveclear, vision, team buffs. 
-Scaling → Assign based on stage-specific influence.

1. DamageProfile (Raw damage output)
physicalDamage – How much consistent or burst physical damage the champion deals.
1 = negligible physical damage
3 = moderate damage, situational (e.g., Shen)
5 = extremely high physical damage (e.g., Jinx)

magicDamage – How much consistent or burst magic damage the champion deals.
1 = negligible magic damage
3 = moderate magic damage (e.g., Kai'sa)
5 = very high magic damage (e.g., Brand)

2. DamageType (Teamfight damage style)
burst – Short, high-damage impact in fights.
1 = none
3 = moderate burst potential (e.g., aatrox, camile)
5 = very high burst (e.g., LeBlanc, Syndra)

dps – Sustained damage over the fight.
1 = negligible DPS
3 = moderate sustained damage (e.g., Ezreal)
5 = extremely high consistent damage (e.g., Aphelios)

poke – Ability to safely chip away at enemies from range.
1 = none
3 = moderate poke potential (e.g., kennen)
5 = exceptional poke (e.g., Xerath)

range – Effective attack or spell range.
1 = melee only, very short range
3 = moderate range (e.g., samira, ryze)
5 = long-range champion (e.g., Jhin, Xerath)

3. Survivability (Teamfight staying power)
tankiness – Resistance to damage (HP, armor, MR, shields).
1 = extremely squishy
3 = moderate tankiness (e.g., irellia, riven)
5 = extremely tanky (e.g., Malphite, Ornn)

sustain – Healing or regeneration (self-heal, shields).
1 = none
3 = moderate sustain (e.g., Sylas, irellia)
5 = high sustain (e.g., Aatrox, Dr. Mundo)

mobility – Ability to move and reposition (dashes, blinks, speed boosts).
1 = no mobility
3 = moderate mobility (e.g. Aatrox, Jarvan)
5 = extreme mobility (e.g., Nocturne (Global Ults), LeBlanc)

disengage – Ability to peel, escape, or prevent enemies from engaging.
1 = none
3 = moderate (e.g., Ashe, Orianna)
5 = strong disengage tools (e.g., Janna, Gragas)

4. CrowdControl (Teamfight control)
hardCC – amount of & reliability of Stuns, roots, suppresses, knock-ups, etc.
1 = none
3 = moderate CC (e.g., Ahri, Malphite)
5 = high hard CC (e.g., Leona)

areaControl - amount of AOE & space making ability.
1 = none
3 = moderate control (e.g., caitlyn(E ability))
5= high control (e.g., heimerdinger, zyra, gangplank)

engage – Ability & reliability to start fights effectively.
1 = none
3 = moderate engage (e.g., ahri, jhin)
5 = excellent engage potential (e.g., Sejuani, Rakan)

peel – Ability to protect carries and prevent enemy threats.
1 = none
3 = moderate (e.g., twisted fate, azir) 
5 = strong peel (e.g., Lulu, Janna)

5. Utility (Macro / game impact)
waveclear – Ability to quickly clear minions or jungle camps.
1 = negligible
3 = moderate (e.g., aatrox, riven)
5 = extremely strong (e.g., Ziggs)

vision – Ability to provide vision or control vision in fights.
1 = none
3 = moderate (e.g., elise (bush checking), orianna (q into areas))
5 = high vision potential (e.g., Maokai, zyra)

teamBuffs – Shields, attack speed, heals, or other supportive effects.
1 = none
3 = moderate (e.g., sivir, twisted fate (R ability's vision provide))
5 = very strong team buffs (e.g., Lulu, Karma)

6. Scaling (Stage relevance)
early – Impact in the early game (laning phase / early skirmishes).
1 = weak early
3 = moderate
5 = strong early (e.g., Draven, Elise)

mid – Impact in mid-game (first big teamfights).
1 = weak
3 = moderate
5 = strong (e.g., Sylas, Renekton)

late – Impact in late game (teamfights, objectives).
1 = weak late
3 = moderate
5 = strong late (e.g., Jinx, Azir)

You can give champions scores between 1-5, if a champion's score is better than 3 but worse than 5 give it a for, likewise, better than 1, worse than 3, give it 2.
