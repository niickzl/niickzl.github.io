I am building a League of Legends draft analysis tool. I need you (a professional league of legends coach) to generate accurate champion characteristics in JSON format for every champion in order as of patch 15.17 (Sept 10, 2025). 

Rules (strict): 
1. Each subcategories must have a score between 0-4.
2. Distribute points based on champion identity, teamfight impact, and stage-specific effectiveness. 
3. DO NOT LOOK AT META, base the score off champion mechanics.
4. Base allocations on champion identity, teamfight impact, and game-stage relevance. 
5. Follow the JSON structure exactly as shown below. 

Guidance for categories: 
-DamageProfile → Assign points based on raw damage output. 
-DamageType / Survivability → Assign based on teamfight impact. 
-Utility → Assign based on macro/game impact. 
-Scaling → Assign based on stage-specific influence.

1. DamageProfile (Raw damage output)
physicalDamage – How much consistent or burst physical damage the champion deals.
0 = negligible physical damage
2 = moderate damage, situational (e.g., Shen)
4 = extremely high physical damage (e.g., Jinx)

magicDamage – How much consistent or burst magic damage the champion deals.
0 = negligible magic damage
2 = moderate magic damage (e.g., Kai'sa)
4 = very high magic damage (e.g., Brand)

2. DamageType (Teamfight damage style)
burst – Short, high-damage impact in fights.
0 = none
2 = moderate burst potential (e.g., aatrox, camile)
4 = very high burst (e.g., LeBlanc, Syndra)

dps – Sustained damage over the fight.
0 = negligible DPS
2 = moderate sustained damage (e.g., Ezreal)
4 = extremely high consistent damage (e.g., Aphelios)

poke – Ability to safely chip away at enemies from range.
0 = none
2 = moderate poke potential (e.g., kennen)
4 = exceptional poke (e.g., Xerath)

aoe – Strength/size of AOE.
0 = no/negligible aoe
2 = moderate aoe (e.g., syndra, braum)
4 = massive aoe (e.g., brand, kennen, rell)

3. Survivability (Teamfight staying power)
tankiness – Resistance to damage (HP, armor, MR, shields).
0 = extremely squishy
2 = moderate tankiness (e.g., irellia, riven)
4 = extremely tanky (e.g., Malphite, Ornn)

sustain – Strength of healing or shielding to self or allies.
0 = none
2 = moderate sustain (e.g., Sylas, irellia)
4 = high sustain (e.g., Soraka, Dr. Mundo)

mobility – Ability to move and reposition in a fight(dashes, blinks, speed boosts).
0 = no mobility
2 = moderate mobility (e.g. Aatrox)
4 = extreme mobility (e.g., ezreal)

peel – Ability to protect carries and prevent enemy threats.
0 = none
2 = moderate (e.g., azir, gragas) 
4 = strong peel (e.g., Lulu, Janna)

4. Utility (Macro / game impact)
waveclear – Ability to quickly clear minions or jungle camps.
0 = negligible
2 = moderate (e.g., aatrox, riven)
4 = extremely strong (e.g., Ziggs)

vision – Ability to provide vision or control vision in fights.
0 = none
2 = moderate (e.g., elise (bush checking), orianna (q into areas))
4 = high vision potential (e.g., Maokai, zyra)

objectiveControl – Ability to securing/complete objectives like dragons and barons.
0 = none
2 = moderate secure(e.g. Cait(W zoning))
4 = very strong secure(e.g., nunu(Q), poppy(R))

roam– Ability/speed to rotate/roam around the map.
0 = none
2 = moderate roam
4 = very strong roam (globals) (e.g., taliyah, nocturne, shen)

6. Scaling (Stage relevance)
early – Impact in the early game (laning phase / early skirmishes).
0 = weak early
2 = moderate
4 = strong early (e.g., Draven, Elise)

mid – Impact in mid-game (first big teamfights).
0 = weak
2 = moderate
4 = strong (e.g., Sylas, Renekton)

late – Impact in late game (teamfights, objectives).
0 = weak late
2 = moderate
4 = strong late (e.g., Jinx, Azir)

You can give champions scores between 0-4, if a champion's score is better than 2 but worse than 4 give it a 3, likewise, better than 0, worse than 2, give it 1.

JSON Structure: "ChampionName": { "characteristics": { "DamageProfile": { "physicalDamage": X, "magicDamage": X }, "DamageType": { "burst": X, "dps": X, "poke": X, "aoe": X }, "Survivability": { "tankiness": X, "sustain": X, "mobility": X, "peel": X }, "Utility": { "waveclear": X, "objectiveControl": X, "vision": X, "roam": X }, "Scaling": { "early": X, "mid": X, "late": X } , "Essential": { "hardCC": X, "engage": X }}}

Task: Generate characteristics for all champions in alphabetical order.
