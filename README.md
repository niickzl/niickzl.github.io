Nick's LICENSE choice explaination:
I chose the MIT License as it is said to be the "leanest license".
Moreover, my website was no private technology/patent, meaning I had no need of preventing people from using it.

I learned about the MIT and other licenses from [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/nicolasdao/a7adda51f2f185e8d2700e1573d8a633#1-mit)
